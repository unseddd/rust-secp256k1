     *  This formula has the benefit of being the same for both addition
     *  of distinct points and doubling. However, it breaks down in the
     *  case that either point is infinity, or that y1 = -y2. We handle
     *  these cases in the following ways:
     *
     *    - If b is infinity we simply bail by means of a VERIFY_CHECK.
     *
     *    - If a is infinity, we detect this, and at the end of the
     *      computation replace the result (which will be meaningless,
     *      but we compute to be constant-time) with b.x : b.y : 1.
     *
     *    - If a = -b, we have y1 = -y2, which is a degenerate case.
     *      But here the answer is infinity, so we simply set the
     *      infinity flag of the result, overriding the computed values
     *      without even needing to cmov.
     *
     *    - If y1 = -y2 but x1 != x2, which does occur thanks to certain
     *      properties of our curve (specifically, 1 has nontrivial cube
     *      roots in our field, and the curve equation has no x coefficient)
     *      then the answer is not infinity but also not given by the above
     *      equation. In this case, we cmov in place an alternate expression
     *      for lambda. Specifically (y1 - y2)/(x1 - x2). Where both these
     *      expressions for lambda are defined, they are equal, and can be
     *      obtained from each other by multiplication by (y1 + y2)/(y1 + y2)
     *      then substitution of x^3 + 7 for y^2 (using the curve equation).
     *      For all pairs of nonzero points (a, b) at least one is defined,
     *      so this covers everything.

 * To harden against timing attacks, use the following mechanism:
 * * Break up the multiplicand into groups of PREC_B bits, called n_0, n_1, n_2, ..., n_(PREC_N-1).
 * * Compute sum(n_i * (PREC_G)^i * G + U_i, i=0 ... PREC_N-1), where:
 *   * U_i = U * 2^i, for i=0 ... PREC_N-2
 *   * U_i = U * (1-2^(PREC_N-1)), for i=PREC_N-1
 *   where U is a point with no known corresponding scalar. Note that sum(U_i, i=0 ... PREC_N-1) = 0.
 * For each i, and each of the PREC_G possible values of n_i, (n_i * (PREC_G)^i * G + U_i) is
 * precomputed (call it prec(i, n_i)). The formula now becomes sum(prec(i, n_i), i=0 ... PREC_N-1).
 * None of the resulting prec group elements have a known scalar, and neither do any of
 * the intermediate sums while computing a*G.

 *  default handler will be used. The library provides a default handler which
 *  writes the message to stderr and calls abort. This default handler can be
 *  replaced at link time if the preprocessor macro

 *  has been configured with --enable-external-default-callbacks. Then the

 *   - void secp256k1_default_error_callback_fn(const char* message, void* data);
 *  The library can call these default handlers even before a proper callback data
 *  pointer could have been set using secp256k1_context_set_illegal_callback or
 *  secp256k1_context_set_error_callback, e.g., when the creation of a context

 *  With ECDSA a third-party can forge a second distinct signature of the same
 *  message, given a single initial signature, but without knowing the key. This
 *  is done by negating the S value modulo the order of the curve, 'flipping'
 *  the sign of the random point R which is not included in the signature.
 *
 *  Forgery of the same message isn't universally problematic, but in systems
 *  where message malleability or uniqueness of signatures is important this can
 *  cause issues. This forgery can be blocked by all verifiers forcing signers
 *  to use a normalized form.
 *
 *  The lower-S form reduces the size of signatures slightly on average when
 *  variable length encodings (such as DER) are used and is cheap to verify,
 *  making it a good choice. Security of always using lower-S is assured because
 *  anyone can trivially modify a signature after the fact to enforce this
 *  property anyway.
 *
 *  The lower S value is always between 0x1 and
 *  0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF5D576E7357A4501DDFE92F46681B20A0,
 *  inclusive.
 *
 *  No other forms of ECDSA malleability are known and none seem likely, but
 *  there is no formal proof that ECDSA, even with this additional restriction,
 *  is free of other malleability. Commonly used serialization schemes will also
 *  accept various non-unique encodings, so care should be taken when this
 *  property is required for an application.
 *
 *  The secp256k1_ecdsa_sign function will by default create signatures in the
 *  lower-S form, and secp256k1_ecdsa_verify will not accept others. In case
 *  signatures come from a system that cannot enforce this property,
 *  secp256k1_ecdsa_signature_normalize must be called before verification.
