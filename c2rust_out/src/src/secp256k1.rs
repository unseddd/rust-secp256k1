/* * Given that p is congruent to 3 mod 4, we can compute the square root of

 *  so we test at the end by squaring and comparing to the input.
 *  Also because (p+1)/4 is an even number, the computed square root is

 *   print C.order().factor(limit=1000)
 *
 * 2. Choose an order as one of the prime factors listed in the above step.
 *    (You can also multiply some to get a composite order, though the
 *    tests will crash trying to invert scalars during signing.) We take a
 *    random point and scale it to drop its order to the desired value.
 *    There is some probability this won't work; just try again.

 *   assert(P.order() == order)

 * 3. Print the values. You'll need to use a vim macro or something to

 *  we find as solution for a unified addition/doubling formula:
 *    lambda = ((x1 + x2)^2 - x1 * x2 + a) / (y1 + y2), with a = 0 for secp256k1's curve equation.
 *    x3 = lambda^2 - (x1 + x2)
 *    2*y3 = lambda * (x1 + x2 - 2 * x3) - (y1 + y2).
 *
 *  Substituting x_i = Xi / Zi^2 and yi = Yi / Zi^3, for i=1,2,3, gives:
 *    U1 = X1*Z2^2, U2 = X2*Z1^2
 *    S1 = Y1*Z2^3, S2 = Y2*Z1^3

 *
 *  This formula has the benefit of being the same for both addition
 *  of distinct points and doubling. However, it breaks down in the
 *  case that either point is infinity, or that y1 = -y2. We handle
 *  these cases in the following ways:
 *
 *    - If b is infinity we simply bail by means of a VERIFY_CHECK.
 *
 *    - If a is infinity, we detect this, and at the end of the
 *      computation replace the result (which will be meaningless,
 *      but we compute to be constant-time) with b.x : b.y : 1.
 *
 *    - If a = -b, we have y1 = -y2, which is a degenerate case.
 *      But here the answer is infinity, so we simply set the
 *      infinity flag of the result, overriding the computed values
 *      without even needing to cmov.
 *
 *    - If y1 = -y2 but x1 != x2, which does occur thanks to certain
 *      properties of our curve (specifically, 1 has nontrivial cube
 *      roots in our field, and the curve equation has no x coefficient)
 *      then the answer is not infinity but also not given by the above
 *      equation. In this case, we cmov in place an alternate expression
 *      for lambda. Specifically (y1 - y2)/(x1 - x2). Where both these
 *      expressions for lambda are defined, they are equal, and can be
 *      obtained from each other by multiplication by (y1 + y2)/(y1 + y2)
 *      then substitution of x^3 + 7 for y^2 (using the curve equation).
 *      For all pairs of nonzero points (a, b) at least one is defined,
 *      so this covers everything.

 *
 *  When this function has not been called (or called with fn==NULL), then the
 *  default handler will be used. The library provides a default handler which
 *  writes the message to stderr and calls panic!. This default handler can be
 *  replaced at link time if the preprocessor macro
 *  USE_EXTERNAL_DEFAULT_CALLBACKS is defined, which is the case if the build
 *  has been configured with --enable-external-default-callbacks. Then the

 *   - void secp256k1_default_error_callback_fn(const char* message, void* data);
 *  The library can call these default handlers even before a proper callback data
 *  pointer could have been set using secp256k1_context_set_illegal_callback or
 *  secp256k1_context_set_error_callback, e.g., when the creation of a context
 *  fails. In this case, the corresponding default handler will be called with
 *  the data pointer argument set to NULL.

 *  In:   sigin:  a pointer to a signature to check/normalize (cannot be NULL,
 *                can be identical to sigout)
 *
 *  With ECDSA a third-party can forge a second distinct signature of the same
 *  message, given a single initial signature, but without knowing the key. This
 *  is done by negating the S value modulo the order of the curve, 'flipping'
 *  the sign of the random point R which is not included in the signature.
 *
 *  Forgery of the same message isn't universally problematic, but in systems
 *  where message malleability or uniqueness of signatures is important this can
 *  cause issues. This forgery can be blocked by all verifiers forcing signers
 *  to use a normalized form.
 *
 *  The lower-S form reduces the size of signatures slightly on average when
 *  variable length encodings (such as DER) are used and is cheap to verify,
 *  making it a good choice. Security of always using lower-S is assured because
 *  anyone can trivially modify a signature after the fact to enforce this
 *  property anyway.
 *
 *  The lower S value is always between 0x1 and
 *  0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF5D576E7357A4501DDFE92F46681B20A0,
 *  inclusive.
 *
 *  No other forms of ECDSA malleability are known and none seem likely, but
 *  there is no formal proof that ECDSA, even with this additional restriction,
 *  is free of other malleability. Commonly used serialization schemes will also
 *  accept various non-unique encodings, so care should be taken when this
 *  property is required for an application.
 *
 *  The secp256k1_ecdsa_sign function will by default create signatures in the
 *  lower-S form, and secp256k1_ecdsa_verify will not accept others. In case
 *  signatures come from a system that cannot enforce this property,
 *  secp256k1_ecdsa_signature_normalize must be called before verification.
